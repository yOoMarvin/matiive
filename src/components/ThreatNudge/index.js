              I bumped into a pedestrian while cycling. He sufferd severe
              injuries from the collision and also demanded compensation for the
              damages. I have never thought how many things such a damage could
              include: compensation for pain, pension payments, loss of wages,
              costs for a nanny.
            </p>
            <p>The loss amount was around $30,000.</p>
            <p>
              I'm so glad that I had a private liabilty insurance like{" "}
              <i>matiive</i> that saved my life by covering all the costs!
